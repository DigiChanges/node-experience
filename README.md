### Execute DEV Environment
- ```docker-compose up --build -d```
- Also, you could use ```make dev```
- ```docker-compose exec node bash dev.init.sh```
- Also, you could use ```make init```

### Execute Debug DEV Environment
- ```make debug```

Create Push Notifications Keys
- ```docker-compose exec node npx ts-node src/command.ts createVapID```

## Optimized Transpilation 

There is a hot reloading using bash and git files. With this mechanism we can transpile only the files
that are necessary to transpile, in addition there are also files to take care of eliminating the transpiled files
that they are not in the project in case of deleting them, when that happens, as nodemon is used for the refresh, in the
case of the remove files does not restart and in that specific case it should be restarted manually. Although in the 
normal development process. It would not be necessary since eventually you would be modifying another file and it 
would automatically transpile that file and delete the file that was deleted.

As it is still in the experimentation phase, the process may fail. In the event of failure, you can choose to manually 
compile the file that failed to compile or directly execute ```yarn tsc``` to compile everything again. 

## How to use TypeORM:

Node experience comes integrated with Mongoose as the default ORM. It also has TypeORM integrated to use any SQL engine 
that is required.

To change from Mongoose to TypeORM the following steps must be followed:
     
     To take an example we are going to use Postgres.
     
     1. Environment variables have to be changed.
        a. DB_PORT=27017 -> DB_PORT=5432
        b. DB_TYPE_DEFAULT=Mongoose -> DB_TYPE_DEFAULT=TypeORM
    
    2. Important note. The filters and sorting files of each entity should also have a change depending on the relationship.
        For example UserSort has
       
       class UserSort extends Sort
       {
            static readonly EMAIL: string = 'email';
            static readonly CREATED_AT: string = 'createdAt';
       ...
       
       This should change to
       
       class UserSort extends Sort
       {
            static readonly EMAIL: string = 'i.email';
            static readonly CREATED_AT: string = 'i.createdAt';
       ...
       
           This is because typeORM and SQL aliases are used and in this case it is necessary for you to 
           understand each filter and each order that we need to add.
     3. Finally, we have a command with Makefile to lift the corresponding containers.
        a. make dev_sql
        b. The command with docker compose would be:
                
                docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sql.yml up --build -d
           
           This above command replaces the mongo container with the postgres container.
