## Work in Progress

### Started

To begin with, you must understand that the project is divided by domains.

* Auth - In this domain we can find everything related to authentication and authorization with JWT.
* Config - Configuration domain. Here we will find several configuration files. In addition, we will also find a folder called `config` in the root of the project. In that folder we are going to find the possible configuration by environment and a file that changes it through the environment variables.
* File - In this domain we can find part of the file system.
* Item - An example domain.
* Notification - Domain for email notifications and web push notifications.
* Role - Domain to manage roles within the system.
* User - Domain to manage users.
* Shared - Exceptional domain, are classes that are used throughout the system.
  
     * Application - Everything related to libraries like express or koa.
     * Domain - It is the basic domain layer as a base.
     * Exceptions - These are general exceptions.
     * Factories - These are the factories that are used throughout the system.
